# Quote of the Week

> What I actually value on a daily basis in \[rust is\]
> I can call code written by other people without unpleasant surprises.
>
> ```
> async fn verify_signature(token: &Jwt) -> Result<Claims, VerificationError>
> ```
>
> Looking at a code snippet:
>
> * I know my JWT token won't be mutated, just accessed ( `&` );
> * I know the function will probably perform some kind of I/O ( `async` );
> * I know that the function might fail ( `Result` );
> * I know its failure modes ( `VerificationError` ).
