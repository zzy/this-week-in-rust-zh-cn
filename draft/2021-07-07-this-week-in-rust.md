### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

We only have partial results this week (more details in full report). From the results we have collected, we have one small regression and several improvements.
Also, there was a broad [max-rss regression](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=29cd70d40722930e66a8b726fe58a7bd1d64a22b&end=6b354a13820a444f834a33365ae4a8d97d7d27ce&stat=max-rss) from 11 days ago.
and narrower [max-rss regression](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=406d4a9cc3b9601cf98a07c6c83e0227d64f5d48&end=4573a4a879a8e1f773944a8859e4dcd136138af8&stat=max-rss) from 9 days ago.

# Quote of the Week

> When a panic has a payload that's an object which needs Drops,  
> And the panic hits a catch_unwind for unexpected stops  
> Before if its Drop panicked we'd just crash to your desktops,  
> Now the payload gets forgotten, and you'd better grab some mops!
