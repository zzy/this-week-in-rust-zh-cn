## Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A lot of noise in the benchmark results this week. We are discussing ([zulip archive](https://zulip-archive.rust-lang.org/247081tcompilerperformance/06104coercionsdebugnoise.html), [live zulip](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/247081-t-compiler.2Fperformance/topic/coercions-debug.20noise)) how best to update the benchmark set to eliminate the noisy cases that are bouncing around. Beyond that, some large improvements to a few individual benchmarks.

The memory usage ([max-rss](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=2021-05-11&end=2021-05-18&absolute=true&stat=max-rss)) seemed largely flat. Except for an upward trend on `tuple-stess` that indicates 4% more memory from a week ago.

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.
Revision range: [382f..25a2](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=382f748f23979e37e3e012b090e5a0313463f182&end=25a277f03df7e44643ddfcc240d034409cb2f505&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

5 Regressions, 7 Improvements, 2 Mixed
1 of them in rollups

[Full report here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-05-18.md).

# Quote of the Week

> I often think about Rust as a process and community for developing a programming language, rather than as a programming language itself.
